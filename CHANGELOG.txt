= v0.2.0

  * Warning: API changed significantly from v0.1.0 because it was dreadful :D
  * Allowed outputs to be configured separately from the project.
  * Included gems in osx-app more safely, so that no files will be missing.
  * Added :exe archive format (win32 self-extractor, made on any OS).
  * Added :win32_folder_from_wrapper output (win32 folder made from a pre-made wrapper, made on OSX/Linux).
  * Can create an "empty" win32 wrapper (created on win32 to be used to generate the :win32_folder_from_wrapper on non-win32 OSes).
  * Allowed project and outputs to have archive formats (called on Project, affects all outputs).
  * No longer require Innosetup installed to create :win32_folder output
